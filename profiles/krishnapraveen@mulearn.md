| Fraud Detection in     Fraudulent activities in bank payments have become a significant concern for financial institu￾tions and customers alike, as technology advances and transactions increasingly shift to digital
  Bank Payments using 
  Machine Learning    | platforms. Traditional fraud detection methods struggle to keep pace with the sophisticated tac￾tics employed by fraudsters. To address these challenges, this paper explores the application of
                        machine learning algorithms for fraud detection in bank payments. This research provides an overview of various machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learn￾ing, deep learning, and anomaly detection, and examines their potential in detecting fraudulent
                        transactions effectively.
